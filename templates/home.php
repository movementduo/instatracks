		<p class="orange">Actually about what's in your pictures</p>
		<p>OK. What do I need to do? Just connect your instagram account and push the button. Fanta x You instatracks does the rest. We'll pick the pictures at random</p>
		<p class="orange">But I want to choose my own pictures...?</p>
		<p>That's okay too. After the first video. You can make your selection so long as you choose 4 to 6 pictures.</p>
		<p>Yep! Wait 20 secs or so and your instatracks video will be right here. Email it yourself to keep. Share it on instagram or TBH. Do whatever you like with it.</p>
